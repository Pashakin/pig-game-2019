# Pig game

[Pig game](pashakin.github.io/pig-game/) is a first project coded by following the instructions of [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/?persist_locale=&locale=en_US), created by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman).

In this project I mastered:

- DOM manipulation
- event handler
- anonymous and callback functions
- state variable

## Game rules

The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.

In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score.

But, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.

The player can choose to "Hold", which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.

The first player to reach 100 points on the GLOBAL score wins the game.
